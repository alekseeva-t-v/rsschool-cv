## About Me

For over 10 years, I worked in a major telecommunications company providing cellular services. My responsibilities included interacting with key corporate and VIP clients, as well as selling company products. I also served as a mentor, assisting new employees with their adaptation and helping them solve complex issues.

As a hobby, I spent several years doing website layout and working with website builders, assisting in website publication. This experience inspired me to pursue further development in this field.

I have completed courses from **Netology**, including ***"JavaScript Programming for Beginners"*** and ***"React for JS Developers,"*** as well as the ***"JavaScript/Front-end Stage#0"*** course from **Rolling Scopes School**. I am passionate about web development due to its endless opportunities for professional growth. Additionally, I am aware of the abundance of high-quality free resources and the supportive developer community, which makes this profession even more appealing.

I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will lead me to become a proficient frontend developer.
